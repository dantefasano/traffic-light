# Traffic Light Project

This is a Traffic Light project, created as part of the Self-Paced Full Stack Bootcamp at 4Geeks Academy.

The goal of this project is to create a simple React application that simulates a traffic light. Users can interact with the traffic light by clicking on the individual lights (red, yellow, green), and toggle the active light. Additionally, users can add a "purple" light to the traffic light system.
